Contributing
============

We ❤️ Pull Requests! To get a patch landed:

1. Fork the repo and create your feature branch: ``git checkout -b awesome‑feature``.
2. Install dev dependencies: ``pip install -e ".[dev]"``.
3. Keep code **lint‑clean**: ``ruff .`` and ``black --check .``.
4. Write / update **tests** and ensure ``pytest`` passes.
5. Submit a PR. A project maintainer will review within a few days.
