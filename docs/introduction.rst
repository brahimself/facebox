Introduction
============

FaceBox is a lightweight Python toolkit for **real‑time face recognition and facial‑emotion analysis** built on top of
OpenCV’s *dnn* module.  
It offers:

* **Face detection** using Haar‑cascade classifiers.
* **128‑D face embeddings** generated by the OpenFace ``nn4.small2.v1`` network.
* **Signature matching** for identity recognition with an intuitive API.
* **Emotion classification** (8 FER+ classes) via an ONNX network.
* A **plug‑and‑play demo** (`run.py`) that works with any webcam.

Whether you need a simple attendance kiosk, research prototype, or a teaching demo, FaceBox keeps the barrier
to entry delightfully low.
