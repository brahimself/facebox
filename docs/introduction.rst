Introduction
============

FaceBox is a Python toolkit for **real‑time face recognition and facial‑emotion analysis** built on top of
OpenCV’s *dnn* module. This project is made by Brahim JARRACHI KHAYYA and Ismail KHLIFI TAGZOUTI as a part of the course : Scientific Python.

It offers:

* **Face detection** using Haar‑cascade classifiers.
* **128‑D face embeddings** generated by the OpenFace ``nn4.small2.v1`` network.
* **Signature matching** for identity recognition with an intuitive API.
* **Emotion classification** (8 FER+ classes) via an ONNX network.
* A **plug‑and‑play demo** (`run.py`) that works with any webcam.
